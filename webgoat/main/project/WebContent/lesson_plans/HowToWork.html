<b>Read and edit Parameters</b><br><br>
To read and edit Parameters you need a proxy to intercept the HTTP request. Here we use WebScarab. More informations to WebScarab you will get in the Chapter "Useful Tools".
After installing WebScarab and making a proxy on localhost we can start.<br><br>

We have to select "intercept request" in the tab "Intercept". If we send a new HTTP request now, we get a new WebScarab window.<br><br>

Here we can read and edit the sent parameter. After "Accept changes" the request will be sent to the server.
<br><br><br>
<b>Read and edit Cookies</b><br><br>
Often it is not only necessary to change the value of parameters but to change the value of cookies. We use again WebScarab and intercept the request as explained in the last topic.<br><br>

We again get the new window on sending a HTTP request. On the screenshot you see where we can find cookies and how to edit the values of them.
