<h1>How To Work With WebGoat</h1>
<p>
Welcome to a short introduction to WebGoat.<br> 
Here you will learn how to use WebGoat and additional tools for the lessons.<br><br>
</p>
<h1>Environment Information</h1>
<p>
WebGoat uses Apache Tomcat as server. It is setup to run on localhost. This
configuration is for single user. If you want to use WebGoat in a laboratory or in 
class you might need to change the setup. Please refer to the Tomcat Configuration 
in the Introduction section.</p>

<h2>The Interface Of WebGoat</h2>

2. This link will give you the technical background to solve the lesson.<br>
3. Do you need some help to find the solution? Here you will find useful hints.<br>
4. Here you will find a complete solution of the selected lesson.<br>
5. If you want to restart a lesson you can use this link.</p>
<h2>Solve The Lesson</h2>
<p>
Always read first the lessons plan. Then try to solve the lesson and if necessary, 
use the hints. If you cannot solve the lesson using the hints, you may watch the 
solution. Every step is explained there.</p>
<h2>Read And Edit Parameters</h2>
<p>
To read and edit Parameters you need a local proxy to intercept the HTTP request. 
Here we use WebScarab. More informations to WebScarab you will get in the 
Chapter "Useful Tools".
After installing WebScarab and using it as proxy on localhost we can start.<br><br>

We have to select "Intercept Request" in the tab "Intercept". If we send a HTTP request we get a new WebScarab window.<br><br>

Here we can read and edit the sent parameter. After "Accept changes" the request will be sent to the server.
</p>
<h2>Read And Edit Cookies</h2>
<p>
Often it is not only necessary to change the value of parameters but to change the value of cookies. We use again WebScarab and intercept the request as explained in the last topic.<br><br>
<img src="/WebGoat/images/introduction/HowToUse_3.jpg"><br><br>
We get a new window on sending a HTTP request. On the screenshot you see where we can find cookies and how to edit the values of them.
