== The Console tab

In the console tab you can see anything, which a loaded JavaScript file may have printed out to it.
Don't worry if you see something in red. While that is an error, it has probably resolved itself.
Through the Console Tab, it is also possible for you to run your own line of javascript code.

Start by clearing console using the shortcut CTRL+L.

To run your own JavaScript. Simply click inside  of the console, write something like:
`console.log("Hello WebGoat!");` and hit enter. Hello WebGoat should now appear in your console.
You can also do some basic arithmetic, with the console. If you type for example `1+3` and hit
enter the console should display 4.

Note: The `undefined` that may also appear in the console if you hit enter. You can safely  ignore this Statement,
it does only mean, that the JavaScript function you have called did not return anything, therefor `undefined`.
