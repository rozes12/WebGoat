== What is XSS

NEED DEFINITION.

==== Cross site scripting (XSS) is the most prevalent and pernicious web application security issue

==== XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes user originated data and sends it to a web browser without validation or encoding

=== XSS allows attackers to execute script in the victim’s browser and take over the user’s browser using scripting malware

==== Examples:
* From the browser address bar (chrome, Firefox)
+
----
javascript:alert("XSS Test");
javascript:alert(document.cookie);
----
* Any data field that is returned to the client is potentially injectable
+
----
<script>alert("XSS Test")</script>
----

== Try It!  Using Chrome or Firefox 
Type in `javascript:alert(document.cookie);` in the URL bar.  If you /cut/paste you'll need to add the `javascript:` back in.  Try it on a different tab.
