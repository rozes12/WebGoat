== Creating the password reset link

When creating a password reset link you need to make sure:

- It is a unique link with a random token
- It can only be used once
- The link is only valid for one hour

Send a link with a random token means an attacker cannot start a simple DOS attack to your website by starting to
block users. The link should not be used more then once which makes it impossible to change the password again.
The time out is necessary to restrict the attack window, having a link opens up a lot of possibilities for the attacker.
