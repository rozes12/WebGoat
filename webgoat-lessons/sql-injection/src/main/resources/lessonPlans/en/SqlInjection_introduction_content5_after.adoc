==== Here are some examples of what a hacker could supply to the input field to perform actions on the database that go further than just reading the data of a single user:

* `+Smith’ OR ‘1’ = ‘1+` +
results in `+"SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE NAME = 'Smith' OR TRUE;+` and that way will return all entries from the users table
* `+Smith’ OR 1 = 1; --+` +
results in `+"SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE NAME = 'Smith' OR TRUE;--';+` and that way will return all entries from the users table
* `+Smith’; DROP TABLE USERS; TRUNCATE AUDIT_LOG; --+` +
chains multiple SQL-Commands and deletes the USERS table as well as entries from the audit_log
