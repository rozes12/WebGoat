== Try It!   String SQL injection

The query in the code builds a dynamic query as seen in the previous example.  The query is build by concatenating strings making it susceptible to String SQL injection:

------------------------------------------------------------
"SELECT * FROM USER_DATA WHERE FIRST_NAME = 'John' AND LAST_NAME = '" + lastName + "'";
------------------------------------------------------------

Using the form below try to retrieve all the users from the users table. You should not need to know any specific user name to get the complete list.
