== What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injections are the most common web hacking techniques. *A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of malicious code via the SQL query input from the client to the application.* If not dealt with correctly, such an injection of code into the application can have an serious impact on e.g. data integrity and security.

SQL Injections can occur, when unfiltered data from the client, e.g. the input of a search field, gets into the SQL-Interpreter of the application itself. If the input from the client does not get checked for containing SQL Commands, hackers can easily manipulate the underlying SQL-Statement to their advantages. +
Per example if the input is not filtered for SQL metacharacters like *--* (comments out the rest of the line) or *;* (ends a SQL-query and that way can be used to chain them)
