=== Data Definition Language (DDL)

Data definition language includes commands for defining data structures, especially database schemas which tell how the data should reside in the database.

If an attacker uses a SQL injection of the DDL type to manipulate your database, he will violate the following of the three protection goals in information security: integrity (alter) & availability (drop). (Only people authorized to change/delete the data can do so.)


* DDL commands are used for creating, modifying, and dropping the structure of database objects.
* CREATE - to create a database and its objects like (table, views, â€¦)
* ALTER - alters the structure of the existing database
* DROP - delete objects from the database
* Example:
** CREATE TABLE Employees( +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IdNum INT NOT NULL, +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LName VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL, +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FName VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL, +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JobCode VARCHAR (3) NOT NULL, +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary DECIMAL (18, 2), +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone VARCHAR (20), +
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMARY KEY (IdNum) +
);
** This statement creates the employees example table given on page 2.

Now try to modify the schneme by removing the column "Phone" from the table "Employees":
