== Compromising Integrity with Query Chaining
After compromising the confidentiality of data in the previous lesson, this time we are gonna compromise the integrity of data by using a SQL query chaining.

=== What is SQL query chaining?
Query chaining is exactly what it sounds like. When query chaining, you try to append one or more queries to the end of the actual query.
You can do this by using the *;* metacharacter which marks the end of a query and that way allows to start another one right after it within the same line.

=== It's your turn!

Of course you cannot leave it at that. +
Better go and change your salary so you're at the earner.
