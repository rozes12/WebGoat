== Try It!   Numeric SQL Injection

The query in the code builds a dynamic query as seen in the previous example.  The query in the code builds a dynamic query by concatenating a number making it susceptible to Numeric SQL injection: 

--------------------------------------------------
"select * from users where Login_Count = " + Login_Count + " and USERID = "  + userID;
--------------------------------------------------

Using the form below try to retrieve all the users from the users table. You shouldn't need to know any specific user name or Login_Count to get the complete list.
