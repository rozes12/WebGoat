StringSqlInjectionSecondStage=Now that you have successfully performed an SQL injection, try the same type of attack on a parameterized query.  Restart the lesson if you wish to return to the injectable query.
EnterLastName=Enter your last name:

sql.injection.title=SQL Injection
sql.mitigation.title=SQL Injection (mitigation)
sql.advanced.title=SQL Injection (advanced)

SqlInjectionChallenge1=Look at the different response you receive from the server
SqlInjectionChallenge2=The vulnerability is on the register form
SqlInjectionChallenge3=Use tooling to automate this attack

NoResultsMatched=No results matched. Try Again.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a1=The application is taking your input and inserting it at the end of a pre-formed SQL command.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a2=This is the code for the query being built and issued by WebGoat:<br><br> "SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE last_name = "accountName"
SqlStringInjectionHint5a3=Compound SQL statements can be made by joining multiple tests with keywords like AND and OR. Try appending a SQL statement that always resolves to true
SqlStringInjectionHint5a4=Make sure all quotes (" ' ") are opened and closed properly.
SqlStringInjectionHint5a5=Try appending the Statement with something like: OR 1 = 1.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b1=This is the code for the query being built and issued by WebGoat:<br><br> "SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE Login_Count = "Login_Count" and User_Id = "Name"
SqlStringInjectionHint5b2=Note that you don't need to insert any quotations.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b3=Remember how you solved the previous assignment.
SqlStringInjectionHint5b4=It does not matter where you insert a statement that always resolves to true.
SqlStringInjectionHint6=Try Appending a new SQL Statement to the Query.
SqlStringInjectionHint7=The new SQL Statement can be really simple like: SELECT ... FROM ...
SqlStringInjectionHint8=Your new SQL Query should start, with a " ; " and end with " -- "
SqlStringInjectionHint9=Try sorting and look at the request
SqlStringInjectionHint10=Intercept the request and try to specify a different order by
SqlStringInjectionHint11=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens
SqlStringInjectionHint12=Use for example "(case when (true) then hostname else id end)" in the order by and see what happens

sql-injection.5a.success=You have succeeded: {0}
sql-injection.5a.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.

sql-injection.5b.success=You have succeeded: {0}
sql-injection.5b.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.

sql-injection.6a.success=You have succeeded: {0}
sql-injection.6a.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.

sql-injection.6b.success=You have succeeded: {0}
sql-injection.6b.no.results=No results matched. Try Again.
